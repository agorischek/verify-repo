# Verification

Before making a change, you must author a `task.verify.ts` file in the repo root. To see what's available, you can run `bun verify:docs`. Before making changes, run `bun verify` from the repo root and show that the file you authored fails. Then work on the requested task. You're not done until `bun verify` passes.

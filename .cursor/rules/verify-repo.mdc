# Overview

You must author task-specific checks before beginning work, and you must run all checks before completing your work.

## Checking initial health

Before starting code work, run `bun verify` from the repo root and make sure everything passes.

## Adding task-specific checks

Before making code changes, you must add repo verification checks. You and run them to show that they fail (because the code work isn't done). Run `bun verify:docs` to learn about APIs available. Checks should be defined in files with the *exact* filename `task.verify.ts`. These can be located anywhere in the repo.

## Completing work

Before you complete your work, you should also run `bun verify`, and fix any issues it discovers.
